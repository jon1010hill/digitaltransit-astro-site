# Building on UK Rail Engagement in Peru and Chile

Digital Transit Ltd recently completed a trade mission to Peru and Chile where leadership presented the company's flagship safety and cybersecurity technologies to regional infrastructure stakeholders. The initiative, organized by the UK Department for Business and Trade from June 30–July 4, 2025, positioned DTL's solutions within Latin America's expanding rail modernization efforts.

## Key Technologies Presented

CEO Howard Parkinson showcased two primary offerings:

**CyRail®** — An operational technology cybersecurity platform aligned with TS 50701 and IEC 63452 standards, designed to strengthen compliance across metro, freight, and passenger rail systems.

**RAPORS** — An AI-enabled assessment system for safety-critical software that automates safety-critical software assessment and compliance checks, potentially reducing safety case documentation timeframes by approximately 40%.

## Market Relevance

Both solutions address specific infrastructure challenges in Peru and Chile, where rail systems require enhanced operational resilience and regulatory adherence. The technologies are undergoing pilot evaluations in Singapore, Hong Kong, and the UK.

## Future Plans

DTL intends to return in October 2025 for additional discussions centered on critical infrastructure cybersecurity, alongside other UK technology innovators.

# Why Compliance Matters: Breaking Down TS 50701 and IEC 62443 for Rail Operators

The rail industry faces mounting pressure to defend critical infrastructure against cyber threats while maintaining safety and reliability. Digital Transit Limited addresses this challenge by explaining two essential compliance standards.

## CENELEC TS 50701 Overview

TS 50701 is a Technical Specification from the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (2021) designed specifically for railway cybersecurity. The standard encompasses:

- Risk assessments for cybersecurity
- Security level assignments (SL1–SL4)
- Asset inventory protocols
- Vulnerability management procedures
- Supplier security expectations
- Integration with RAMS processes

Railway Infrastructure Managers, operators, system integrators, and product suppliers must apply this standard across the full lifecycle, from concept through decommissioning.

## IEC 62443 Explained

IEC 62443 is a globally applicable cybersecurity standard developed by the ISA99 committee. It addresses industrial control systems across manufacturing, utilities, and transportation sectors.

The standard introduces Zone and Conduit Modelling, requiring organizations to define sensitive asset locations and data flow pathways between them. Security levels (SL1-SL4) determine protection requirements based on criticality and exposure.

## Consequences of Non-Compliance

Real-world incidents demonstrate the risks:

- Deutsche Bahn experienced WannaCry ransomware affecting train signage (2017)
- Merseyrail suffered a ransomware attack with data leakage (2021)

Beyond incidents, non-compliance creates barriers to funding, fails audits, and exposes organizations to legal liability under frameworks like the EU NIS2 Directive.

## Digital Transit Solutions

**CyRail** automates TS 50701 and IEC 62443 compliance through gap analysis dashboards, document verification, lifecycle tracking, and evidence generation for auditors.

**RAPORS** addresses EN 50716 and EN 50128 requirements with automated risk analysis, SIL-level traceability, and software safety case development.

## Future Outlook

Over the next five years, expectations include TS 50701 evolution into a full standard, IEC 62443 becoming mandatory for procurement, integrated cybersecurity-safety frameworks, and AI-powered automated assurance tools.

# Cybersecurity in Rail: The Urgent Need for Protection in the Railway Industry

The rail sector faces mounting digital transformation challenges. As systems become increasingly interconnected, the industry confronts expanded vulnerabilities that threaten operational continuity.

## Recent Cybersecurity Incidents

Several significant attacks demonstrate the growing threat:

- **March 2025 (Ukraine):** Ukrzaliznytsia experienced disruptions affecting both passenger and freight transport, forcing reversion to manual ticketing
- **Scotland:** Railway infrastructure remains under-prepared for sophisticated threats, with vulnerabilities in digitally-controlled signaling systems
- **October 2022 (Denmark):** DSB operator faced widespread cancellations traced to a single point of failure triggered cascade across systems
- **August 2023 (Poland):** 20 trains halted via VHF radio system exploitation; resolution required six hours
- **December 2023 (Poland):** Supply chain software malfunction caused denial-of-service disruptions

## Industry Challenges

Five critical obstacles emerge:

1. **Expanding threat surface** through interconnected systems lacking original cybersecurity design
2. **Fragmented standards** creating regulatory complexity and implementation inconsistencies
3. **Skill gaps** in specialized OT cybersecurity expertise
4. **Integration risks** across unsecured multi-source applications
5. **Cultural resistance** to secure-by-design adoption

## CyRail AI Solution

Digital Transit Limited promotes CyRail, an AI-powered platform offering:

- Real-time threat monitoring with live vulnerability databases
- Automated compliance documentation against IEC 62443, TS 50701, NIS2, and IEC 63452
- Integration with Enterprise Architect and internal repositories
- Built-in workforce training programs
- Context-specific cybersecurity guidance through retrieval-augmented generation

The platform addresses the unique security requirements of operational technology in rail environments, helping organizations protect critical infrastructure while maintaining compliance with industry standards.
